# THIS IS JUST THE DEFAULT NUSHELL CONFIG

You can find the **nushell repository** [here](https://github.com/nushell/nushell)
Just got the package to try it out.

I still use bash as my shell.
(I'm already used to ls | grep)

Also bash has more functionality.

But **nushell** does have a more user-friendly experience and a better TUI.
